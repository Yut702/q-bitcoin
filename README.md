## Predicting Interest Rates with Quantum Computing (utokyo qff 2025)
### Swaption Price Estimation Challenge

This project explores using quantum machine learning (QML) to impute missing values and perform short-term forecasting for interest rate swap options (swaptions).

We work with a synthetic swaption price dataset provided by IBM, generated from realistic models, which includes a lattice of tenors/maturities along with time series data. The tasks are:

1. Estimate missing values in the dataset.

2. Forecast prices for the next two weeks.

We leverage the unique capability of quantum circuits to efficiently compute in high-dimensional spaces, applying quantum reservoir computing, variational quantum algorithms, and quantum kernel methods.
